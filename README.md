# Multigraph
Some graph and multigraph algorithms in python

These are algorithms that I've had a hard time
with, and am implementing to increase my
understanding.

1. The graph-theoretic version of the Hungarian algorithm.
2. An algorithm for edge-coloring a multigraph that achieves both Vizing's bound
   and Shannon's bound.  Test file are in Data/EdgeColoring.  The same directory
   contains a script named gendata.py that generates random graphs for testing.
